I opened it in ghidra, found the function that looked most like it was doing something, saw there was a condition, decoded what the condition was (if (local_48==0x86187) -> if input == 549255) and that what followed was some kind of decoding of what was most likely the flag. ran it, gave it 549255, and got the flag.
