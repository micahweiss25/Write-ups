First, get the file <br />
![this works](img/st3go.png)
then, we use a stego tool because I'm stupid and don't know any other way to do it
```
$ zsteg pico.flag.png
```
which returns <br />
![results](img/zsteg_command.png)
and there we go! There's the flag
picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_a1062667}

p.s.
this writeup was to practice using markup language. The solution for the challenge actually comes from ->
