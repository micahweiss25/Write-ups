run, give a's, seg faults. This means you can overwrite the saved RIP because the program tried to return to a position in memory it did not have access to.

main runs vuln, vuln runs gets(buf). 

goal: overflow buf, point saved rip to flag.

first, find the buffsize of vuln
then, find the address of flag()

break at vuln
feed pwn_cyclic
find offset

offset = 64
offset + 8 + payload * spot on

I tried, flag() address = 00401236 bc that is where flag() started in ghidra but then swithed to 0040123b when the challenge said to go to mov, not the start of the function. 

got EOF errors for 30 min and then changed recvline to recv(34) and got the flag picoCTF{b1663r_15_b3773r_be31178c}
