you go to the website,
http://saturn.picoctf.net:50167/
and obviously start by inspecting

there isn't much of subsance but one source points to an image in "secret/assets/DX1KYM.jpg". Go to that location aaaand nothing really there, BUT, if from there you delete the image file.. there is still nothing. FROM THERE THOUGH, you can delete assets and get to secret. Here is you first confirmation you are on the right path. At that page, you inspect again and find hidden/file.css (round two, fight!). Role up to hidden doing the same process and you'll find superhidden/*somefile* and you once again have to do this process for the last time to find the flag hanging out in source.
