## Challenge 

### Description
This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/26704/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:26704

### Hints
You don't need to download a new web browser

## First Steps
Open it up, hit the big flag button. 

## Right Path
It prints an error saying you aren't using picobrowser. I looked up how websites know what browser you are using and I found out about 
the User-Agent. The user agent is in the request headers of the get request. It specifies what OS, browser, etc you are using. I couldn't figure out how 
to do it in firefox, but the link below explains how to use the chrome browser to spoof the user-agent to say you are using a picobrowser. (if you want to know how,
you can follow the link). The request takes you to the page with the flag. 

## Thoughts
google is pretty cool when you know what to look up.
